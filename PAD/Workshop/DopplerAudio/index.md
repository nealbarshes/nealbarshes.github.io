        <h1>Listening to Phasicity and Amplitude in Doppler signals (audio output)</h1>
<p><i><u>Note</u>: This page is a supplement to the <a href="https://nealbarshes.github.io/PAD/Workshop/">"Arterial Diagnostics" workshop</a>.</i></p>

<p><b>Phasicity</b> generally refers to a change in the direction or velocity of a wave. For lower extremity arterial waveforms, this mainly pertains to the <b>systolic</b> component of the waveform.</p> 

<p>The Society for Vascular Medicine and Society for Vascular Ultrasound <a href ="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32667274/">consensus statement</a> [Kim ES, et al. <i>Vasc Med</i> 2020;25:484-506] seems to apply the term phasicity mainly for the direction. 

<p>The velocity of the early part of the systolic component is described by the "upstroke" in the new consensus terminology. The velocity of the systolic upstroke can also be quantified in various ways in the vascular laboratoyr, including systolic acceleration time (seconds) and as a slope / rate of velocity increase (cm/s<sup>2</sup>). "Rapid upstroke" versus "prolonged upstroke" are the consensus terms used to describe these attributes of the early part of the systolic component  </p>

<h3>Multiphasic Doppler signals within the normal range (ABI 1.0-1.3)</h3>

<p><u>Example #1</u>: 56 year-old man with diabetes and non-healing ulcers of the calf and lateral foot. No tobacco history. Mild aortic valve stenosis with normal ejection fraction. Exam findings consistent with venous insufficiency and lymphedema. Severe edema of the affected extremity. Dorsalis pedis Doppler signal was multiphasic. ABI was 1.17. </p>

            <br>
            
<p><u>Example #2</u>: 71 year-old man foot pains. History of atrial fibrillation, hypertension, gout and bunions. No diabetes, no tobacco history. Posterior tibial Doppler signal was multiphasic. ABI was 1.12. </p>

<p>Listen for two distinct sounds during systole in this audio sample. The waveform can be described as "multiphasic" (bidirectional) because of this second sound (representing flow reversal in late systole) can be appreciated. Prior to the consensus nomenclature, this type of waveform had been referred to as "triphasic".</p>

<h3>Doppler signals within the "borderline" range (ABI 0.90-0.99)</h3>

<p><u>Example #3</u>: 64 year-old man with diabetes and tobacco use history. Normal ejection fraction and kidney function. Prior stent in superficial femoral artery and toe amputation for advanced osteomyelitis nearly two years prior. This area remains healed. Posterior tibial artery Doppler signal with ABI of 0.98</p>

<p>Despite the ABI result, the upstroke sounds prolonged and the amplitude of sytole sounds small. This waveform may be a good demonstration of some of the difficulties in using audio output only in the quantification of arterial flow.</p>

<h3>Doppler signals in "mildly impaired" range (ABI 0.70-0.89)</h3>

<p><u>Example #4</u>: <p>58 year-old man with diabetes and advanced heart failure (ejection fraction 20-25%). No history of tobacco use, no significant kidney disease. Evaluation part of a determining heart transplant candidacy. Posterior tibial artery Doppler signal with ABI of 0.85</p>

<p><u>Example #5</u>: Aforementioned 64 year-old man with diabetes and tobacco use history. Normal ejection fraction and kidney function. Prior stent in superficial femoral artery and toe amputation for advanced osteomyelitis nearly two years prior. This area remains healed. Dorsalis pedis artery Doppler signal with ABI of 0.72</p>

<p>Don't be distracted by the volume of the signal during diastole -- this reflection of outflow resistance at the time of the exam, not the pulse wave arriving at the location of the Doppler probe. If you focus on the systolic upstroke, you'll begin to appreciate a lower slope (i.e. not as "sharp" or rapid an upstroke) compared to previous examples. </p>

<h3>Doppler signals in "moderately impaired" range (ABI 0.50-0.69)</h3>

<p>The examples in this range should be notable for a prolonged upstroke and lower amplitude. </p>
    
<p><u>Example #6</u>: 71 year-old man with a history of tobacco use. No history of diabetes, heart disease, or kidney disease. Posterior tibial artery Doppler signal with ABI of 0.67</p>

        <div class='playlist'>

<br>
<p><u>Example #7</u>: 66 year-old man with bilateral calf claudication, diabetes, history of tobacco use, and stage 3 chronic kidney disease. Dorsalis pedis artery Doppler signal with ABI of 0.61</p>

        <div class='playlist'>
        <div class='labeled-audio'><audio preload='metadata' controls loop controlsList="nodownload"><source src='Files/ABI_061_P001LDP.mp3' type='audio/mpeg' ></audio></div>        
<br>
<p><u>Example #8</u>: Contralateral limb of aforementioned 64 year-old man with diabetes and history of tobacco use. Exam done for foot pains. Normal ejection fraction and kidney function. Dorsalis pedis artery Doppler signal with ABI of 0.53</p>

<p>As in Example #5, there seems to be forward flow throughout diastole in this example. This and the elevated heart rate may give one an impression of normality. Focus on the systolic upstroke, however, and you should be able to appreciate the still-lower slope (prolonged upstroke) heard here. </p>

<h3>Doppler signals in "severely impaired" range (ABI <0.50)</h3>

<p>The examples of signals in this range are clearly abnormal: minimal amplitude and very prolonged systolic upstroke. Prior to the consensus nomenclature, these would have been referred to as "monophasic."</p>
    
<p><u>Example #9</u>: Contralateral limb of aforementioned 66 year-old man with bilateral calf claudication, diabetes, history of tobacco use, and stage 3 chronic kidney disease. Posterior tibial artery Doppler signal with ABI of 0.46</p>

<br>
<p><u>Example #10</u>: Contralateral limb of aforementioned 71 year-old man with a history of tobacco use. No history of diabetes, heart disease, or kidney disease. Posterior tibial artery Doppler signal with ABI of 0.38</p>
