# Arterial Diagnostics Workshop

We are excited to offer a half-day workshop on arterial diagnostic -- contemporary strategies to identify lower extremity peripheral artery disease. Our goal is to teach participants how to accurately incorporate findings from physical exam, bedside evaluation, non-invasive arterial testing (ex. ankle-brachial indices, or ABIs) into care for patients with patients with foot ulcers or gangrene.

---------------------------------------------
Course Content Overview
---------------------------------------------
PART 1: Arterial Tree Anatomy & Anatomic Imaging

1a: How normal macrovascular and microvascular anatomy supplies blood to soft tissue of the foot. 
1b: The “angiosome” concept. The three angiosomes of the foot. Empiric studies on angiosomes.
1c: Hagen–Poiseuille equation. Newer understanding of pathologic changes that impair perfusion.
1d: A primer on anatomic imaging of the arterial tree: tibial & pedal arteries, "wound blush", medial artery calcifications, and atherosclerotic occlusive disease on diagnostic angiograms. CTAs and MRAs.

Exercise: Review x-rays and angiograms to identify significant lesions, angiosome-directed flow, "wound blush" and medial artery calcifications.



PART 2: Physiology and Physiologic Testing: Methods, Accuracy and Limitations

2a: The cardiac cycle and the normal arterial waveform
2b: Perfusion vs. flow vs. velocity; determinants of oxygen and nutrient delivery.
2c: How much blood flow is needed? Metabolic demands in wound healing and infection. Pathergy.
2d: Methods, interpretation, diagnostic accuracy, and limitations of pressure-based modalities: 
    2d-1: ankle-brachial indices, 
    2d-2: toe-(digit-) brachial indices
    2d-3: skin perfusion pressures
    2d-4: transcutaneous oximetry
    2d-5: plethysmography & systolic slopes

Exercise: Review sample reports from non-invasive testing to identify peripheral artery disease in patients with non-healing foot ulcers.



PART 3: Signs, Signals, Suggested Strategies and Specific Situations

3a: Bedside assessments: exam findings, pedal pulse exam, and handheld Doppler signals (incl. nomenclature).
3b: Suggested strategies for PAD identification.
3c: A rank-ordering of arterial flow from revascularization procedures: normal, AT+PT, angiosome-directed, peroneal only, "in-line" to the ankle, etc..
3d: Special situations: dorsum & heel wounds; partial foot (transmetatarsal/TMA) amputations.

Exercise: Review clinical vignettes, then identify best testing modality and discuss wound healing prognosis for the given situation. 



PART 4: Summary, final Q&A.
