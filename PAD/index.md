# Ensure or Establish Adequate Arterial Inflow

<i>With revascularization</i>, 1-year limb salvage rates among patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) and a foot ulcer, foot infection, or foot gangrene with is [90% (see review)](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/articles/Barshes%2C%20framework%20for%20foot%20keeping.pdf). 

If PAD is <i>untreated</i> or <i>unrecognized</i>, 1-year limb salvage rates are [50-60% (see review)](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/articles/Barshes%2C%20framework%20for%20foot%20keeping.pdf).

Thus, the <b>identification and treatment of PAD</b> in patients with foot ulcers may be the <b>single most influential factor in amputation prevention</b>. Revascularization is [cost-effective](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/articles/Barshes%2C%20MOVIE%20analysis.pdf) and may even provide [cost-savings in frail, elderly patients](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/articles/Barshes%2C%20marginal%20patient%20bypass.pdf).

<i>(Venn diagram from our [2013 "System of Care" review paper](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/articles/Barshes%2C%20system%20of%20care%202013.pdf))</i>

<br>
<br>
A [formal decision analysis](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/articles/Barshes%2C%20PAD%20identification%20strategies.pdf) identified these as the two most sensitive strategies to identify PAD in patients with foot ulcers:
<br>
<br>
<b><u>strategy 1</u>:</b> non-invasive testing (esp. toe-brachial index or skin perfusion pressure) for <b>everyone</b>, angiogram to investigate abnormal results = 83% sensitivity.
<br>
<br>
<b><u>strategy 2</u>:</b> pedal pulse exam first; non-invasive testing (esp. toe-brachial index or skin perfusion pressure) to corroborate adequate arterial perfusion vs. angiogram to investigate abnormal pulse exam findings = 92% sensitivity.
<br>
<br>
Reserving non-invasive testing for patients with weak or absent pedal pulses, then doing angiography only if this is abnormal is associated with a <b>low</b> sensitivity rate in finding PAD.

Simply put, <span style="color:red">these findings suggest that <b><u>all</u> patients with foot ulcers</b> should get <b>objective testing</b></span>, either in the form of an <span style="color:red"><b>angiogram</b></span> or <span style="color:red"><b>non-invasive testing</b></span>.</blockquote>.
<br>
<br>
<br>

| In addition, <b>consider angiography if any of the following specific situations are present:</b>  |
|---|
| pedal pulses weak or absent  |
| continuous wave Doppler signal is monophasic |
| toe-brachial index <0.7  |
| toe pressure <60mmHg  |
| lowest ABI (lower ankle pressure:highest brachial pressure) <0.9 |
| ulcer size >3cm |
| infection requiring >3cm incision for drainage  |
| ulcers in multiple locations/angiosomes  |
| foot ulcer in area supplied by single angiosome: heel, dorsal foot  |
| anticipated Lisfranc amputation, rotational flap, or free flap reconstruction  |

Our hospital's vascular surgery experience began as part of the Baylor College of Medicine peripheral vascular surgery training program initiated by Dr. Michael E. DeBakey in the 1980s (K. Mattox, <i>The History of Surgery in Houston). It is currently the busiest VA vascular surgery service in the country. We serve a patient population with a more racial diversity than even the city of Houston as a whole. In total, our program's experience in limb salvage have put our surgical trainees at the 86th percentile for peripheral obstructive cases.

### Infrainguinal Endovascular Procedures

In the clinic, consider: (1) indication; (2) feeling for bilateral femoral pulses, ipsilateral popliteal and pedal pulses; and (3) bedside vein mapping. 
Plan for pre- and post-admission if eGFR<60mL/min: normal saline at 0.5mL/kg/hr, vitamin C 500mg BID, acetylcysteine 600mg PO BID.

In planning the case, consider: (1) indication/wound location & relevant angiosome(s); (2) antiplatelets/anticoagulants; (3) baseline eGFR; (4) pulse exam & vein mapping (from clinic note); (5) any previous imaging. Posting should generally use the 36247 code, NOT any procedural code beginning with a 7.

Procedure in basic steps: Bentson to get 5Fr sheath in; Contra/Omni to the aorta. Up-and-over with floppy angled Glidewire. Try to get floppy Glidewire to popliteal. If successful, place a 135cm Quickcross catether for the angiograms starting in distal leg. Visualize more proximal segments later.

Ultimately, [these seven digital subtraction angiography runs](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/assets/BarshesAngiogramViews.pdf) with the following power injector settings for the affected extremity: 
1. popliteal at 20&deg; oblique, 5x5
2. upper calf w tibia-fibula separated, 5x5-10
3. calf w tibia-fibula separated, 5x5-10 
4. craniocaudal foot shot magnifiedx1, 4x12
5. lateral foot shot magnified x1, 4x12
Then, after withdrawing the catheter more proximally:
6. AP thigh, 5x5
7. femoral at 15&deg; oblique, 5mL/sec for 5mL.

If severely impaired eGFR, consider carbon dioxide angiography with [this setup](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/assets/CO2angioSetUp.pdf).
If intervention: long Amplatz wire through Quickcross + 45cm 6Fr (if SFA/pop) or 55/70cm 5Fr (if tibial). Cross, shoot DSA, PTA, consider stent.

After the case: bedrest x six hours. Generally an outpatient procedure. Inpatient observation again only if needed for hydration, renal protection. Discharge without outpatient narcotics (Tylenol only), Plavix bolus if intervention. Consider cilostazol otherwise. 

### Procedural Details for Infrainguinal Bypasses

In the clinic before the operation, consider: prior operations in index extremity; angiogram results; vein mapping (NOT done in vascular lab) if not already done during previous hospital stay. Pre-admitted is discouraged, regardless of eGFR/creatinine.

Before the case, consider: (1) indication; (2) hemoglobin; (3) eGFR; (4) planned conduit (single-segment saphenous vein, then [spliced arm vein](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/articles/MOVIEconduitAnalysis.pdf), then PTFE with [distal vein patch](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/articles/DistalVeinPatches.pdf)), (5) baseline anti platelet / anticoagulation medications. I will mark vein course using ultrasound BEFORE the patient gets to the room.

On the field: 4-0 silk ties; 7-0 Prolene. magnet pad, Ioban x3. Supine, left arm tucked (unless left arm vein harvest is planned). Drape just above the umbilicus. Isolation bag if tibial/pedal target, stockinette otherwise. If foot wound: foot should be prepared with chlorhexidine scrub in preference to not iodine-based solutions. Our OR team generally knows to open 4-0 silk ties, 7-0 Prolene, vein solution and other typical accoutrements; therefore, no list is included here. All members of the team should do a full five-minute hand scrub. 

Five main steps: 1) vein harvest; 2&3) distal & proximal exposures; 4) tunneling + anastomoses; 5) closure.

The bundle we've employed to [reduce surgical site infections by 67%](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/articles/ZamaniSSIreduction.pdf):
1. Minimize hospital pre-admission.
2. Methicillin-sensitive <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> decontamination protocol with mupirocin nasal ointment, chlorhexidine wipes or shower. This is routinely done through our outpatient clinic.
3. Vancomycin in wound ONLY if re-do case AND no vein in the field.
4. Interrupted 2-0 Vicryl to close dead space.
5. Subcuticular skin closure with  4-0 Monocryl. Avoid staples in groin incisions.
6. Negative pressure wound therapy (transparent dressing “window panes”, Adaptec, black sponge, more transparent dressings).
