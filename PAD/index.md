# Ensure or Establish Adequate Arterial Inflow

With revascularization, 1-year limb salvage rates among patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) and a foot ulcer, foot infection, or foot gangrene with is 90%. 
If PAD is untreated or unrecognized, 1-year limb salvage rates are 50-60%.
Thus, identification and treatment of PAD may be the single most influential factor in amputation prevention.

Based on a formal decision analysis, the two most sensitive strategies to identify PAD in patients with foot ulcers are:

| In addition, <b>consider angiography if any of the following specific situations are present:</b>  |
|---|
| pedal pulses weak or absent  |
| continuous wave Doppler signal is monophasic |
| toe-brachial index <0.7  |
| toe pressure <60mmHg  |
| lowest ABI (lower ankle pressure:highest brachial pressure) <0.9 |
| ulcer size >3cm |
| infection requiring >3cm incision for drainage  |
| ulcers in multiple locations/angiosomes  |
| foot ulcer in area supplied by single angiosome: heel, dorsal foot  |
| anticipated Lisfranc amputation, rotational flap, or free flap reconstruction  |
