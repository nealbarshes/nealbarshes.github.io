# Ensure or Establish Adequate Arterial Inflow

<i>With revascularization</i>, 1-year limb salvage rates among patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) and a foot ulcer, foot infection, or foot gangrene with is [90% (see review)](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/articles/Barshes%2C%20framework%20for%20foot%20keeping.pdf). 

If PAD is <i>untreated</i> or <i>unrecognized</i>, 1-year limb salvage rates are [50-60% (see review)](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/articles/Barshes%2C%20framework%20for%20foot%20keeping.pdf).

Thus, the <b>identification and treatment of PAD</b> may be the <b>single most influential factor in amputation prevention</b>. Revascularization is [cost-effective](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/articles/Barshes%2C%20MOVIE%20analysis.pdf) and may even provide [cost-savings in frail, elderly patients](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/articles/Barshes%2C%20marginal%20patient%20bypass.pdf).

Based on a [formal decision analysis](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/articles/Barshes%2C%20PAD%20identification%20strategies.pdf), the two most sensitive strategies to identify PAD in patients with foot ulcers are:

| In addition, <b>consider angiography if any of the following specific situations are present:</b>  |
|---|
| pedal pulses weak or absent  |
| continuous wave Doppler signal is monophasic |
| toe-brachial index <0.7  |
| toe pressure <60mmHg  |
| lowest ABI (lower ankle pressure:highest brachial pressure) <0.9 |
| ulcer size >3cm |
| infection requiring >3cm incision for drainage  |
| ulcers in multiple locations/angiosomes  |
| foot ulcer in area supplied by single angiosome: heel, dorsal foot  |
| anticipated Lisfranc amputation, rotational flap, or free flap reconstruction  |

### Infrainguinal endovascular interventions

In the clinic, consider: (1) indication; (2) bilateral femoral pulses, ipsilat. popliteal and pedal pulses; (3) bedside vein mapping. 
Plan for pre- and post-admission if eGFR<60mL/min: NS@0.5mL/kg/hr, vitamin C 500mg BID, acetylcysteine 600mg PO BID.

In planning the case, consider: (1) indication/wound location & relevant angiosome(s); (2) antiplatelets/anticoagulants; (3) baseline eGFR; (4) pulse exam & vein mapping (from clinic note); (5) previous imaging (if it exists).

Procedure in basic steps: Bentson (NB & NH) or stiff angled GlideWire (JC) to get 5Fr sheath in; Contra/Omni to the aorta. JC: aortogram. Up-and-over with floppy angled Glidewire. Try to get floppy Glidewire to popliteal. If successful, place a 135cm Quickcross catehter for the angiograms starting in distal leg. 

Ultimately, seven digital subtraction angiography runs for extremity of interest: (a) femoral at 15 degrees ipsiAO, 5/s for 5mL; (b) AP thigh, 5x5; (c) popliteal at 20 ipsiAO, 5x5; (d & e) upper and lower calf w tib-fib separated, 5x5-10; (e) CC foot shot magnifiedx1, 4x12; (f) lateral foot shot magnified x1, 4x12. Power injector with aforementioned volumes/rates (NB) vs. hand injections: 2-6mL except for foot shot (JC & NH). 

If intervention: long Amplatz wire through Quickcross + 45cm 6Fr (if SFA/pop) or 55/70cm 5Fr (if tibial). Cross, shoot DSA, PTA, consider stent.

After the case: bedrest x six hours. Obs. again if needed for hydration, renal protection. Discharge without outpatient narcotics (Tylenol only), Plavix bolus if intervention. Consider cilostazol otherwise. 

### Infrainguinal Bypasses

In the clinic before the operation, consider: vein mapping (NOT done in vascular lab) if not already done during previous hospital stay. Pre-admitted is discouraged, regardless of eGFR/creatinine.

Before the case, consider: (1) indication; (2) hemoglobin; (3) eGFR; (4) planned conduit, (5) baseline anti platelet / anticoagulation meds. I will mark vein course using ultrasound BEFORE the patient gets to the room.

On the field: 4-0 silk ties; 7-0 Prolene. magnet pad, Ioban x3. Supine, left arm tucked (unless arm vein harvest) drape above the umbilicus; isolation bag if tibial/pedal target, stockinette otherwise. If foot wound: gets prep’ed with chlorhexidine. Do a full five-minute hand scrub.

Five steps: 1) vein harvest; 2&3) distal & proximal exposures; 4) tunneling + anastomoses; 5) closure.

The bundle we've employed to [reduce surgical site infections by 67%](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/articles/ZamaniSSIreduction.pdf):
1. minimize pre-admission
2. methicillin-sensitive <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> decontamination protocol with mupirocin nasal ointment, chlorhexidine wipes or shower
3. vancomycin in wound ONLY if re-do case AND no vein in the field
4. interrupted 2-0 Vicryl to close dead space
5. subcuticular skin closure with  4-0 Monocryl
6. negative pressure wound therapy (transparent dressing “window panes”, Adaptec, black sponge, more transparent dressings).

<b>Post-op:</b> to SICU overnight. NS @ ~0.5mL/kg/hr x12 hours. Blood count, basic metabolic panel and PT/PTT/INR now; blood count and basic metabolic panel in morning. Add baseline brain naturetic peptide (BNP) if known CHF. Initiate prophylaxis against DVT and start multimodal pain regimen. Clear liquid diet, solid foot breakfast. Text orders for out of bed to cardiac chair in AM, to not manipulate leg wrap, and to keep overhead lights on and curtains open during daytime hours (7A-9PM). Ignore SICU template orders that don't apply (ex. extubation parameters).
  
Multimodal pain regimen:
1. Tylenol 500mg PO q6h SCHEDULED.
2. Tramadol 50mg q4h PRN for break-through pain
3. Options if still not controlled: morphine 15-30mg PO q4h or fentanyl patch.  Ibuprofen, ketorolac or other NSAIDs ONLY if eGFR>60.
AVOID oxycodone (Percocet), hydromorphone (Dilaudid), benzodiazepines. 

<b>POD#1:</b> Out of bed to cardiac chair by 9AM. Foley out, wean any O2. Transfer to 5E/5B in afternoon. Saline lock IV. Consider Lasix. PT consult. Don’t order labs.

<b>POD#2:</b> Out or bed. Remove and replace leg wrap (ok to give patient break for a few hours). Tell patient to make plans to get home day 4. Order AM hematocrit +/- repeat BNP. BMP only if ESRD.

<b>POD#3:</b> Start Eliquis is spliced vein and HAS-BLED < or =3, cilostazol if single segment vein. Start Plavix if PTFE. Discharge with 30 tabs tramadol OR 20 tabs Tylenol #3.
