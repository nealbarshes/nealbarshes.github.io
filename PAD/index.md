# Ensure or Establish Adequate Arterial Inflow

<i>With revascularization</i>, 1-year limb salvage rates among patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) and a foot ulcer, foot infection, or foot gangrene with is [90% (see review)](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/articles/Barshes%2C%20framework%20for%20foot%20keeping.pdf). 

If PAD is <i>untreated</i> or <i>unrecognized</i>, 1-year limb salvage rates are [50-60% (see review)](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/articles/Barshes%2C%20framework%20for%20foot%20keeping.pdf).

Thus, the <b>identification and treatment of PAD</b> may be the <b>single most influential factor in amputation prevention</b>. Revascularization is [cost-effective](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/articles/Barshes%2C%20MOVIE%20analysis.pdf) and may even provide [cost-savings in frail, elderly patients](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/articles/Barshes%2C%20marginal%20patient%20bypass.pdf).

Based on a [formal decision analysis](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/articles/Barshes%2C%20PAD%20identification%20strategies.pdf), the two most sensitive strategies to identify PAD in patients with foot ulcers are:

| In addition, <b>consider angiography if any of the following specific situations are present:</b>  |
|---|
| pedal pulses weak or absent  |
| continuous wave Doppler signal is monophasic |
| toe-brachial index <0.7  |
| toe pressure <60mmHg  |
| lowest ABI (lower ankle pressure:highest brachial pressure) <0.9 |
| ulcer size >3cm |
| infection requiring >3cm incision for drainage  |
| ulcers in multiple locations/angiosomes  |
| foot ulcer in area supplied by single angiosome: heel, dorsal foot  |
| anticipated Lisfranc amputation, rotational flap, or free flap reconstruction  |
