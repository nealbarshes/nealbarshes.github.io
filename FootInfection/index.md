### Tenets of Treatment:
1. Deep infections get drained/incised. 
2. Ensure or establish adequate arterial inflow.
3. Reconstruct, reestablishing intact epithelium over the entire extremity.
4. Maintain mobility through the avoidance of amputation.

### Medications:
S=Statin
A=Aspirin 81mg  & Antibiotic: ceftriaxone 1gm IV q24h. 
         Vancomycin only if MRSA nares swab is positive OR if  pre-op. for abscess I&D
V=Vitamin C 500mg PO BID
E=”Ensure” BID (though Glucerna SR has lowest added sugar)

T=Tylenol for pain or temperature >100.4F
He=Heparin subcutaneous q8h. Do not hold for OR

L=Lactobacillus 2 caps PO BID
I=Insulin: 50% of long-acting insulin home dose + sliding scale PRN
M=Multivitamin 1 cap daily
B=Blood pressure meds, baseline + at least one PRN for SBP>140mmHg.

Continue all home meds except metformin, Coumadin, other anticoagulants

### Laboratory investigations
1. Type and SCREEN
2. CBC with differential
3. Complete metabolic panel
4. CRP,  procalcitonin, and brain naturetic peptide (BNP)
5. PT/PTT/INR only if on anticoagulation

### Special circumstances: 
1. hypotension (SBP<90): treat like SIRS as above along with: SICU admission; vancomycin + cefipime; LR 30mL/kg (~2L) influsion over 3 hours; norepinephrine if not responding.
2. either tachycardia alone or 2+ SIRS criteria present (temp>100.5, pulse>90/min, RR>20, PaCO2<32, WBC>12K or 10% bands): get blood cultures, serum lactate, ECG, brain naturetic peptide (BNP), CK/CKMB/troponins at admission. Repeat EKG and BNP on day 2. Consult cardiology or vascular medicine if any are abnormal.
3. hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome (HHS): serum osmolality >320 mOsm/kg.
(Serum Osmolality = (2 x (Na + K)) + (BUN / 2.8) + (glucose / 18) . Presumed when glucose >600 with sodium >140 or when glucose >500 with sodium >145..
Admit to ICU. Get serum ketones. Give  0.5-1L NS and start insulin drip. q6h metabolic panels and replace K+. 
4. severe hyperglycemia (glucose 300-499): admit to 5A for insulin drip; give 500mL NS over 24 hours. 

### Day #0/1: Operative Treatment of Infection
ICD-10 L01.91 or I70.261/262; CPTs 28002, 28003, 11043; discuss with STAFF before posting.
Hard requirements for OR requirements: Type & screen; consent; NPO (solids x6h, clear liquids x2h)
Objectives:
1. Incision ± Penrose drain for all abscess tracts. 
2. Obtain fluid, soft tissue or bone for microbiology (NOT swabs)
3. Removal of all necrotic tissue; minimize resection of viable / marginal tissue
4. Irrigate with saline + cysto tubing (not pulse lavage).
5. Dress with gentamicin-impregnated 4x4 gauze in deep areas, Xeroform over shallow ulcer. Wrap with 4” inch Webril + 4” ACE from forefoot to knee to control edema. 

Post-op orders: Continue most admission orders; saline lock IV; add diabetic diet + Glucerna BID, Iodosorb (cadexomer iodine) ointment; Do NOT order labs for POD#1

### Day #1: Boot, Blood flow, wound care.
1. Prosthetics consults for DH walker + 4-point rollator walker + shower bench + wheelchair.
2. Text order for wheelchair + escort to prosthetics department (2B-400)
3. Change dressing, using either cadexomer iodine gel (Iodosorb)
 
1. Continued empiric IV antibiotic dosing. Vanc trough (if applicable)
2. Order POD #2 labs: BMP, CBC with diff, CRP, procalcitonin

6. If palpable pedal pulses → vascular lab consult for ABIs, toe pressures; if NOT palpable →. vascular surgery consult to schedule angiogram +/- intervention.
7. Tell patient to anticipate discharge home in 48 hours. 

 
### Day #1: Boot, Blood flow, wound care.
1. Consult home health for home wound care.
2. Consult infectious disease.
3. Order outpatient wound care supplies.
4. Counsel on smoking cessation (if applicable). Provide resources.
5. Optional: Diabetes education (room 3C-123 0800-1530 M-F, pager 1022)
 
Post-op dressings
component	Use 21st century management:	Don’t use 19th century tactic :
directly on the wound	cadexomer iodine gel (Iodosorb)	wet Kerlix
absorbant layer	2x2 or 4x4 gauze 	dry  Kerlix
to hold it in place	if small: medium Tegaderm 
if large: cast padding (Webril)+ ACE wrap, held in place with 2” paper tape folded to create a “quick release tab	more and more Kerlix, then circumferential 1” silk tape 

  
### Day #2: Preparing for discharge.
1. Consult home health for home wound care.
2. Consult infectious disease.
3. Order outpatient wound care supplies.
4. Counsel on smoking cessation (if applicable). Provide resources.
5. Optional: Diabetes education (room 3C-123 0800-1530 M-F, pager 1022)

Day #3: Transition to outpatient care 
1.	Check final culture results
2.	
3.	Renal adjustments of IV antibiotics (goal vancomycin trough 10-20 mcg/dL)
4.	Discuss smoking cessation.

### Discharge checklist: “ABC DEF”
A=Antibiotic plan
B=Blood flow testing (either toe pressures or angiogram)
C=Consultant follow-up (ECL wound care or Podiatry +/- Infectious Disease)
D=Discharge Disposition
E=Equipment: active dressings +/- wound VAC
F=Footwear (DH walker, or “fracture boot”) + Four point walker; both from prosthetics department
Valid indications for extended post-operative hospitalization beyond POD #3:
-	Bacteremia on admission (needs 7 days IV antibiotics; consult ID team)
