# Deep Infection? Drain/Incise

### First: Be vigilant in identifying soft tissue
Foot infections are a common precursor to the decision for leg amputation. 
Infection can cause systemic illness (including [acute kidney injury](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/articles/AKIosteomyelitis.pdf) and [acute coronary syndrome](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/articles/ACSinDFI.pdf)). 
Surgery is often an important component to the treatment of infection.

Foot infection should be assumed present unless proven otherwise in all patients with the following findings.<br> Absence of any of these findings does <i>NOT</i> rule infection.


|  <b>finding </b> |
|  ---  |
|  nausea  |
|  anorexia  |
|  subjective chills or sweats  |
|  new onset foot pain  |
|  altered mental status  |
|  fever  |
|  tachycardia  |
|  <i>any</i> drainage (not only purulent) |
|  foot or calf edema  |
|  foul odor  |
|  elevated white blood cell count |
|  elevated serum procalcitonin |
|  elevated c-reactive protein |
|  acute kidney injury  |
|  criteria for of [SIRS or septic shock](https://www.mdcalc.com/sirs-sepsis-septic-shock-criteria)  |
|  2+ points on [qSOFA](https://www.mdcalc.com/qsofa-quick-sofa-score-sepsis) |

### Admission orders

#### Laboratory studies
1. Type and SCREEN
2. CBC with differential
3. Complete metabolic panel
4. C-reactive protein (CRP)  
5. procalcitonin
6. brain naturetic peptide (BNP) if new dyspnea/orthopnea, if abnormal EKG or if history of heart failure
7. PT/PTT/INR only if on anticoagulation

### Medications
The acronym "SAVE THe LIMB" will help you remember medications that may be important for hospitalized with foot infections:

Letter | Medication
------------ | -------------
S= | Statin medication
A= | Aspirin 81mg <br>Antibiotic: ceftriaxone 1gm IV q24h
V= | Vitamin C 500mg PO BID <br>Vancomycin with [calculated dosage](https://clincalc.com/Vancomycin/) only if MRSA nares swab is positive OR if  pre-op. for abscess I&D. 
E= | ”Ensure” BID (though Glucerna SR has lowest added sugar)
T= | Tylenol PRN for pain or temperature >100.4F
He= | Heparin subcutaneous q8h. Do not hold for OR
L= | Lactobacillus 2 caps PO BID
I= | Insulin: 50% of long-acting insulin home dose + sliding scale PRN
M= | Multivitamin 1 cap daily
B= | Blood pressure meds, baseline + at least one PRN for SBP>140mmHg

Continue all home meds except metformin, Coumadin, other anticoagulants

Do not empirically treat for <i>Pseudomonas</i>, as this organism represents [only 3% of isolates at our hospital](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/articles/Barshes%2C%20DFO%20treatment%20failure.pdf). Similarly, do not empirically treat for methicillin-sensitive <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA). For those with no abscess and negative MRSA nasal swab testing is negative, MRSA has been found in foot microbiology in only [5% of our patients](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/articles/Ashong%2C%20MRSA%20osteomyelitis%202016.pdf). This increases to [22% with either abscess or MRSA nasal swab findings and to 58% with both](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/articles/Ashong%2C%20MRSA%20osteomyelitis%202016.pdf). 


### Inpatient Management: Operative Treatment of Infection
L02.435/436 (abscess lower limb, right/left ), M65.171/172 (infection) or I70.261/262 (gangrene); procedure 28003 (incision and drainage) or 28820 (toe amputation).
<br>
Objectives:
1. Probe from the instigating ulcer or gangrenous area to identify abscess tracts: 
![probe to find the abscess tract](/assets/FootIncisionDrainage.jpg "probe to find the abscess tract")
2. Incision ± Penrose drain for all abscess tracts
3. Collect fluid, soft tissue or bone for microbiology in sterile container with sterile saline. Swab specimens are discouraged.
4. Removal of all obviously-necrotic tissue. Minimize resection of viable / marginal tissue
5. Pulsatile irrigation with saline solution.
6. Dress with gentamicin-impregnated 4x4 gauze in deep areas, Xeroform over shallow ulcer. Wrap with 4” inch Webril + 4” ACE from forefoot to knee to control edema. 

Post-op orders: Continue most admission orders; saline lock IV; add diabetic diet + Glucerna BID, Iodosorb (cadexomer iodine) ointment; Do NOT order labs for POD#1



### Atypical presentations: 
Situation 1: <b>hypotension</b> (systolic blood pressure <90mmHg): 
<ul>
<li>treat like SIRS as above along with: SICU admission LR 30mL/kg (~2L) influsion over 3 hours</li>
<li>intravenous vancomycin + cefipime</li>
<li>norepinephrine if not responding</li>
</ul>

Situation 2: either <b>tachycardia alone</b> or <b>SIRS syndrome</b> (2+ of temperature >100.5&deg;F or 38&deg;C, pulse >90/minute, respiratory rate >20/minute, PaCO2<32, white blood cell count >12K/mL or 10% bands):
<ul>
<li>get blood cultures, serum lactate, ECG, brain naturetic peptide (BNP), CK/CKMB/troponins at admission.</li>
<li>Repeat EKG and BNP following day.</li>
 <li>Consult cardiology or vascular medicine if any are abnormal.</li>
</ul>

Situation 3: <b>hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome (HHS)</b>: [serum osmolality](https://www.mdcalc.com/serum-osmolality-osmolarity) >320 mOsm/kg. You can presume this is present if glucose >600 + sodium >140 or glucose >500 + sodium >145:
<ul>
<li>Admit to ICU.</li>
<li>Get serum ketones and q6h metabolic panels.</li>
<li>Give  0.5-1L NS and start insulin drip.</li>
<li>Work with medicine team to replace potassium.</li>
</ul>

Situation 4: <b>severe hyperglycemia (glucose 300-499)</b>
<ul>
<li>admit to stepdown for insulin drip.</li>
<li>give 500mL NS over 24 hours. .</li>
</ul>
