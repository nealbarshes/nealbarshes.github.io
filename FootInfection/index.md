# Deep Infections? Drain/Incise

### First: Be vigilant in identifying soft tissue
Foot infections are a common precursor to the decision for leg amputation. 
Infection can cause systemic illness (including acute kidney injury and acute coronary syndrome). 

![Foot infections: put out the fire!](/assets/WildfireColor.jpg "Foot infections: put out the fire!")

Suspect deep soft tissue infection in any of the following situations:

### Inpatient Management: Operative Treatment of Infection
L02.435/436 (abscess lower limb, right/left ), M65.171/172 (infection) or I70.261/262 (gangrene); procedure 28003 (incision and drainage) or 28820 (toe amputation).
Hard requirements for OR requirements: Type & screen; consent. Preferred: NPO (solids x6h, clear liquids x2h).
Objectives:
1. Probe from the instigating ulcer or gangrenous area to identify abscess tracts: 
![probe to find the abscess tract](/assets/FootIncisionDrainage.jpg "probe to find the abscess tract")
2. Incision ± Penrose drain for all abscess tracts
3. Collect fluid, soft tissue or bone for microbiology in sterile container with sterile saline. Swab specimens are discouraged.
4. Removal of all obviously-necrotic tissue. Minimize resection of viable / marginal tissue
5. Pulsatile irrigation with saline solution.
6. Dress with gentamicin-impregnated 4x4 gauze in deep areas, Xeroform over shallow ulcer. Wrap with 4” inch Webril + 4” ACE from forefoot to knee to control edema. 



Post-op orders: Continue most admission orders; saline lock IV; add diabetic diet + Glucerna BID, Iodosorb (cadexomer iodine) ointment; Do NOT order labs for POD#1

### Laboratory investigations
1. Type and SCREEN
2. CBC with differential
3. Complete metabolic panel
4. CRP,  procalcitonin, and brain naturetic peptide (BNP)
5. PT/PTT/INR only if on anticoagulation

### Medications:
The acronym "SAVE THe LIMB" will help you remember medications that may be important for hospitalized with foot infections:

Letter | Medication
------------ | -------------
S= | Statin medication
A= | Aspirin 81mg <br>Antibiotic: ceftriaxone 1gm IV q24h
V= | Vitamin C 500mg PO BID <br>Vancomycin with [calculated dosage](https://clincalc.com/Vancomycin/) only if MRSA nares swab is positive OR if  pre-op. for abscess I&D. 
E= | ”Ensure” BID (though Glucerna SR has lowest added sugar)
T= | Tylenol PRN for pain or temperature >100.4F
He= | Heparin subcutaneous q8h. Do not hold for OR
L= | Lactobacillus 2 caps PO BID
I= | Insulin: 50% of long-acting insulin home dose + sliding scale PRN
M= | Multivitamin 1 cap daily
B= | Blood pressure meds, baseline + at least one PRN for SBP>140mmHg

Continue all home meds except metformin, Coumadin, other anticoagulants


### Atypical presentations: 
Situation 1: <b>hypotension</b> (systolic blood pressure <90mmHg): 
<ul>
<li>treat like SIRS as above along with: SICU admission LR 30mL/kg (~2L) influsion over 3 hours</li>
<li>intravenous vancomycin + cefipime</li>
<li>norepinephrine if not responding</li>
</ul>

Situation 2: either <b>tachycardia alone</b> or <b>SIRS syndrome</b> (2+ of temperature >100.5&deg;F or 38&deg;C, pulse >90/minute, respiratory rate >20/minute, PaCO2<32, white blood cell count >12K/mL or 10% bands):
<ul>
<li>get blood cultures, serum lactate, ECG, brain naturetic peptide (BNP), CK/CKMB/troponins at admission.</li>
<li>Repeat EKG and BNP following day.</li>
 <li>Consult cardiology or vascular medicine if any are abnormal.</li>
</ul>

Situation 3: <b>hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome (HHS)</b>: [serum osmolality](https://www.mdcalc.com/serum-osmolality-osmolarity) >320 mOsm/kg. You can presume this is present if glucose >600 + sodium >140 or glucose >500 + sodium >145:
<ul>
<li>Admit to ICU.</li>
<li>Get serum ketones and q6h metabolic panels.</li>
<li>Give  0.5-1L NS and start insulin drip.</li>
<li>Work with medicine team to replace potassium.</li>
</ul>

Situation 4: <b>severe hyperglycemia (glucose 300-499)</b>
<ul>
<li>admit to stepdown for insulin drip.</li>
<li>give 500mL NS over 24 hours. .</li>
</ul>


### Day #1: Boot, Blood flow, wound care.
1. Prosthetics consults for DH walker + 4-point rollator walker + shower bench + wheelchair.
2. Text order for wheelchair + escort to prosthetics department.
3. Change dressing using either cadexomer iodine gel or Acticoat Flex-3.
1. Continued empiric IV antibiotic dosing. Vanc trough (if applicable).
2. Order POD #2 labs: BMP, CBC with diff, CRP, procalcitonin.
6. If palpable pedal pulses → vascular lab consult for ABIs, toe pressures; if NOT palpable →. vascular surgery consult to schedule angiogram +/- intervention.
7. Tell patient to anticipate discharge home in 48 hours. 

### Day #1: Boot, Blood flow, wound care.
1. Consult home health for home wound care.
2. Consult infectious disease.
3. Order outpatient wound care supplies.
4. Counsel on smoking cessation (if applicable). Provide resources.
5. Optional: Diabetes education.
 
### Day #2: Preparing for discharge.
1. Consult home health for home wound care.
2. Consult infectious disease.
3. Order outpatient wound care supplies.
4. Counsel on smoking cessation (if applicable). Provide resources.
5. Optional: Diabetes education (room 3C-123 0800-1530 M-F, pager 1022)

### Day #3: Transition to outpatient care 
1.	Check final culture results
2.	Renal adjustments of IV antibiotics (goal vancomycin trough 10-20 mcg/dL)
3.	Discuss smoking cessation.

### Discharge checklist: “ABC DEF”
Letter | Item
------------ | -------------
A= | Antibiotic plan
B= | Blood flow testing (either toe pressures or angiogram)
C= | Consultant follow-up (ECL wound care or Podiatry +/- Infectious Disease)
D= | Discharge Disposition
E= | Equipment: active dressings +/- wound VAC
F= | Footwear (DH walker, or “fracture boot”) + Four point walker; both from prosthetics department
