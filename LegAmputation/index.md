### Ensuring this is the best option

Is the patient a candidate for [palliative foot care](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/articles/BarshesPalliativeFoot.pdf)? Most patients with foot ulcers, foot infections, or foot gangrene benefit from [revascularization and limb salvage efforts](https://bcmedu-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/nbarshes_bcm_edu/EaZETgbUS39Ej_P1nh1NsqcBuokEIEbrWStGWvLsMuQEOg?e=RD5J43). Amputation is [more costly](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/articles/Barshes%2C%20MOVIE%20analysis.pdf) and may have [higher perioperative risks](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/articles/BarshesAmpVsBypassRisk.pdf). Nonetheless, amputation can be best for patients who have the potential to be [better off than they would be with wound palliation alone](https://bcmedu-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/nbarshes_bcm_edu/EUpMUsEJlMxJpm53IojsUcABJKiZndxMNy9ncJxunwhy5g?e=IAGKrs).  

### Pre-operative planning

In addition to all the standard pre-operative requirements, patients scheduled for leg amputation should be evaluated by our vascular medicine collegues prior to surgery. There are two reasons for this. First, patients with PAD who have leg amputations have [very high rates of coronary and cerebrovascular events, even compared to other PAD subgroups](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32997098/). Second, while the overall perioperative mortality rate of leg amputation is low, it is higher than for most vascular operations and [is significantly higher than the perioperative mortality for limb salvage operations](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21292432/).

Ask about baseline mobility, stairs leading to or inside the patient's home, and the patient's mode of transportation to and from the medical center for scheduled appointments. Consider referral to the amputee clinic to discuss post-operative rehabilitation. Consider connecting the patient with our team's social worker and/or case manager to discuss the possible need for assistance of various forms after the operation.

<b>Pre-op preparation:</b>
Before day of surgery: x-ray of planned level of amputation (look for hardware).
Day of surgery: Check laterality. Then double check it. Then triple check it.

<b>First part of a two-stage leg ampuation:</b>
Done as an ankle disarticulation through the tibiotalar joint. See this plastic surgeon Dr. Attinger's [description of ankle disarticulation technique](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32600566/) for details. Tissue ±fluid from removed specimen sent in sterile saline for microbiology. 

<b>Transtibial amputation with closure:</b>
Talk to me about the posterior-first approach to protect the gastrocnemius and posterior flap. We will also utilize many of the [principles described by orthopedic surgeon Dr. Michael Pinzur](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21200297/) and many of the [technical details described by plastic surgeon Dr. Christopher Attinger](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24510319/).

1. Prepare: Mark the anterior aspect of the incision 13-19cm from tuberosity. Mark the medial and lateral apices to create a posterior flap that is 1/3rd of the calf circumference. Elevate and use Esmark, then upper calf or thigh tourniquet to 250 mmHg.
2. Divide soft tissue: Use posterior-first approach to protect the gastrocnemius muscle early on. Local anesthetic mixture for five nerves prior to transection: superficial & deep peroneal (lateral and anterior compartments, respectively), tibial (deep posterior compartment), saphenous and sural nerves. Control vascular structures (silk ligature, then stick-tie with 4-0 Prolene). Traction neurectomy vs. nerve implantation with plastic surgery.
3. Divide bone: Use electrical saw. Bevel anterior 1cm at smooth 45 degree angle with power saw also. No rasp, no bone wax. Irrigate the wound with 3L saline on cystoscopy tubing set.
4. “Clean” closure: New gloves, needle drivers and forceps. Possible myodesis, then tenodesis, tension-free with interrupted Vicryl in fascia, not muscle. Allgower-Donati (half-buried) or typical vertical mattress with nylon alternating with staples for skin.
5. Dressing: Place an incisional negative pressure wound therapy dressing using Mastisol and thin transparent strips on skin along the incision, then Adaptec over incision, then black sponge and more transparent dressings, then connector. Follow this with a [tidy leg wrap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUizOiWBvs8) using 4" Webrils (cast padding, NOT Kerlix) x2 and 4" ACE wrap x2. Soft knee immobilizer for transtibial amputations.

<b>Knee disarticulations:</b>
Please see this plastic surgeon Dr. Attinger's [excellent description of a knee disarticulation technique](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25276650/). I am transition to this technique from [this technique](https://bcmedu-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/nbarshes_bcm_edu/ESC67cPk0N9Kl7-D9jh4OhsB-77w1X-BjGlM-8jUnn5YFg?e=scQG3X) and the [modifed Gritti-Stokes technique](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11097446/).
