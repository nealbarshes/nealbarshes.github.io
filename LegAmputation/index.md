### Ensuring this is the best option

Is the patient a candidate for [palliative foot care](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/articles/BarshesPalliativeFoot.pdf)? Amputation may be best for patients who have the potential to be better off than they would be with wound palliation alone.

### Operative Details

Equipment and supplies:
1.  amputation instrument tray
2.  ortho suction tip
3.  stockinette
4.  sterile tourniquet: usually 18” (red) or 24” (brown)
5.  Zimmer oscillating saw w 25mm width blade
6.  “soft” knee immobilizer (transtibial only)
7.  4-0 Prolene on SH needle x2
8.  2-0 Vicryl on CT1 needle x4
9.  2-0 Nylon on FSLX needle x6
10. Skin stapler
11. KCI wound VAC
12. Adaptec x2
13. Mastisol x3
14, 4" ACE wrap x3
15. 4" Webril (NOT Kerlix) x3
16. Cysto tubing and 3L NS
17. TWO sets of everyone’s gloves
18. micro specimen container
19. Coviden smoke evacuator Bovie
20. 50-50 mix of 1% lidocaine and 0.25% marcaine (no epinephrine)

Bovie settings of 30 pure for cut, 65 spray for coagulation. Ask the circulator to scrub the ENTIRE leg: prep foot and any open areas with chlorhexidine soap, then Chloraprep for intact skin. Ask scrub tech/RN to set needle drivers x2, forceps w teeth x2 aside for “clean closure” (as in elective colorectal cases). 

<b>Pre-op preparation:</b>
Before day of surgery: x-ray of planned level of amputation (look for hardware).
Day of surgery: Check laterality. Then double check it. Then triple check it.

<b>Transtibial amputations:</b>
1. Prepare: Mark the anterior aspect of the incision 13-19cm from tuberosity. Mark the medial and lateral apices to create a posterior flap that is 1/3rd of the calf circumference. Elevation and use Esmark, then thigh tourniquet to 250 mmHg.
2. Divide soft tissue: Use posterior-first approach to protect the gastrocnemius muscle early on. Local anesthetic for 5 nerves prior to transection: superficial & deep peroneal (lat. and ant. compartments), tibial (deep post.), saphenous and sural nn. Control vascular structures (stick-tie with Prolene), then traction neurectomy.
3. Divide bone: w power saw. Bevel with power saw too. No rasp, no bone wax. Irrigate the wound w 3L saline.
4. “Clean” closure: New gloves, needle drivers and forceps. +/- myodesis, then tenodesis, tension-free with interrupted Vicryl in fascia, not muscle. Allgower-Donati (half-buried) or typical vertical mattress with nylon alternating with staples for skin.
5. Dressing: Incision wound VAC: Mastisol and thin transparent strips on skin along the incision. Adaptec over incision, then black sponge and more transparent. 4" Webrils x2 and 4" ACE wrap x2. Soft knee immobilizer.

<b>Post-op orders:</b> Solid food diet + Glucerna BID. Start DVT prophylaxis and multimodal pain regimen (see below). Write for H&H only (BMP if ESRD or pre-op electrolyte abnormalities). Consult PT/OT. 

multimodal pain regimen:
1. Tylenol 500mg PO q6h SCHEDULED.
2. Tramadol 50mg q4h PRN for break-through pain
3. Lidocaine patches near surgical site q12h
3. Options if still not controlled: morphine 15-30mg PO q4h or fentanyl patch.  Ibuprofen, ketorolac or other NSAIDs ONLY if eGFR>60.
AVOID oxycodone (Percocet), hydromorphone (Dilaudid), benzodiazepines.

<b>POD#1:</b> Remove Foley on AM rounds. Restart home insulin/diabetes regimen. Verbally ask RN or PCA to get the patient out of bed AND write a text order to that effect. Ensure it’s happened by PM rounds. Figure out disposition.

<b>POD#2:</b> CHANGE WRAP on POD#2, replace with Webril and ACE. Text order for nurses to weigh patient and document weight in the chart.

<b>POD#3:</b> Ask anesthesiology block team to remove nerve block catheter. Start planning discharge disposition. +/- 7 day course of abx directed to operative culture results.

Incisional wound VAC off no later than day 5. Discharge with 25 tablets of tramadol or 15 tablets of Tylenol #3.
