### Ensuring this is the best option

Is the patient a candidate for [palliative foot care](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/articles/BarshesPalliativeFoot.pdf)? Amputation may be best for patients who have the potential to be better off than they would be with wound palliation alone.

### Operative Details

  <b>Equipment and supplies:</b><br>
1.  amputation instrument tray<br>
2.  ortho suction tip<br>
3.  stockinette<br>
4.  sterile tourniquet: usually 18” (red) or 24” (brown)<br>
5.  Zimmer oscillating saw w 25mm width blade<br>
6.  “soft” knee immobilizer (transtibial only)<br>
7.  4-0 Prolene on SH needle x2<br>
8.  2-0 Vicryl on CT1 needle x4<br>
9.  2-0 Nylon on FSLX needle x6<br>
10. Skin stapler<br>
11. KCI wound VAC<br>
12. Adaptec x2<br>
13. Mastisol x3<br>
14, 4" ACE wrap x3<br>
15. 4" Webril (NOT Kerlix) x3<br>
16. Cysto tubing and 3L NS<br>
17. TWO sets of everyone’s gloves<br>
18. micro specimen container<br>
19. Coviden smoke evacuator Bovie<br>
20. 50-50 mix of 1% lidocaine and 0.25% marcaine (no epinephrine)<br>

<br>
<br>
Bovie settings of 30 pure for cut, 65 spray for coagulation. Ask the circulator to scrub the ENTIRE leg: prep foot and any open areas with chlorhexidine soap, then Chloraprep for intact skin. Ask scrub tech/RN to set needle drivers x2, forceps w teeth x2 aside for “clean closure” (as in elective colorectal cases). 

<b>Pre-op preparation:</b>
Before day of surgery: x-ray of planned level of amputation (look for hardware).
Day of surgery: Check laterality. Then double check it. Then triple check it.

<b>Transtibial amputations:</b>
1. Prepare: Mark the anterior aspect of the incision 13-19cm from tuberosity. Mark the medial and lateral apices to create a posterior flap that is 1/3rd of the calf circumference. Elevation and use Esmark, then thigh tourniquet to 250 mmHg.
2. Divide soft tissue: Use posterior-first approach to protect the gastrocnemius muscle early on. Local anesthetic for 5 nerves prior to transection: superficial & deep peroneal (lat. and ant. compartments), tibial (deep post.), saphenous and sural nn. Control vascular structures (stick-tie with Prolene), then traction neurectomy.
3. Divide bone: w power saw. Bevel with power saw too. No rasp, no bone wax. Irrigate the wound w 3L saline.
4. “Clean” closure: New gloves, needle drivers and forceps. +/- myodesis, then tenodesis, tension-free with interrupted Vicryl in fascia, not muscle. Allgower-Donati (half-buried) or typical vertical mattress with nylon alternating with staples for skin.
5. Dressing: Incision wound VAC: Mastisol and thin transparent strips on skin along the incision. Adaptec over incision, then black sponge and more transparent. 4" Webrils x2 and 4" ACE wrap x2. Soft knee immobilizer.

<b>Post-op orders:</b> Solid food diet + Glucerna BID. Start DVT prophylaxis and multimodal pain regimen (see below). Write for H&H only (BMP if ESRD or pre-op electrolyte abnormalities). Consult PT/OT.
