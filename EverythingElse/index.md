### Hemodialysis Access (N18.5 / N18.6)

In the clinic, know:<br>
1. indication (CKD stage 5 vs. ESRD)<br>
2. handedness<br>
3. history of tunneled catheters or pacemakers<br>
4. previous AVFs/AVGs<br>
5. arterial pulse exam<br>
6. eGFR (if CKD) vs weekly hemodialysis schedule (if ESRD)<br>

We will do Duplex US in clinic for vein mapping for all patients. If ESRD: make a plan for hemodialysis within 24 hours prior to case.<br>

Before the case, let’s discuss the aforementioned data. Mark the vein and artery <b>before</b> arrival to operating room. Nerve block by anesthesiology for all patients. For ALL patients: verify venous blood gas potassium is <5 <b><u>before</u></b> the patient goes to the operating room.<br>

Equipment & supplies to ask for: AVF instrument set; ortho tip for suction; two U-drapes; 6-0 Prolene on BV needle; Surgicel Snow. If ESRD or planned AVG, have in the room: 5mm x 40+cm J&J Artegraft (bovine carotid) and Gore tapered 4-7mm Propaten.<br>

Procedure:<br>
1. Cautery-free exposure of the vein, then mobilization.<br>
2. Expose the artery.<br>
3. (If AVG, create tunnel)<br>
4. Give 3,000 units of heparin, then arteriotomy <5mm to reduce the risk of steal syndrome, then anastomoses(s).<br>
5. Doppler to assess flow in vein/AVG and at wrist. <br>
6. Protamine 30mg and police the wound for hemostasis. Do not use hemostatic agents beyond Surgicel. <br>

For brachiobasilic elevation, read the technique described in [this article](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28041805/).<br>

If we are placing a catheters: 16cm for right internal jugular or right subclavian, 20cm for left internal jugular, 20-24cm for femoral vein.<br>
  
After the case: discharge home with driver. Tylenol #3, n=10 pills. One  follow-up visit at 3 weeks. (If brachiobasilic, this should be a pre-op visit for stage 2).<br>

### Peritoneal Dialysis Access (N18.5 or N18.6)  

In clinic: know previous history of abdominal operations, whether renal has a plan utilize catheter two weeks after placement. Check nares for MRSA. Treat with mupirocin nasal prior to operation if positive.<br>

Procedure in five steps:<br>
1. Place ports: Open Hassan technique to anterior fascial layer at least, then and 5mm Optiview with 0-degree scope at/near umbilicus. Change to 30-degree scope. One additional 5mm (non-Optiview/non-balloon) port LUQ or RUQ for grasper. <br>
2. Place stiff wire and sheath: Needle placement 2cm above & 7cm to the left of the umbilicus after checking for inferior epigastric artery. Insert Bentson wire, then 7Fr sheath. Exchange for short (180cm) Amplatz wire, grasping the floppy end as it comes through the sheath tip. Dilate soft tissue with 11Fr sheath, then 14Fr sheath, then 18Fr peel-away sheath. 
3. Insert catheter: Insert Pigtail double-cuffed catheter with coil placed at top of pubis bone. Grasp the catheter as it exits the sheath to direct it into the pelvis. Counter-incision in left abdominal wall for catheter end. Cuff 2-4cm from exit. (If redundant omentum, +/- pexy with 2-0 Prolene. If very obese: pre-sternal exit  with JP-drain Faller; tie extension together).<br>
4. Check function: Remove grasper and camera, then desufflate. Instill 1L of normal saline. Then check for quick return of at least 900mL with bag in dependent position.
5. Close: Close umbilical port with 2-0 Vicryl on UR6 needle, then 3-0 Vicryl in soft tissue. 4-0 Monocryl for skin incisions at umbilicus, right abdominal port site, and left abdomen access site for placement of catheter. No nylon or other suture for catheter exit site. Instill 15mL of heparinized saline 100u/mL; clip and cap. Use 3M Tegaderm CHG ("chlorhexidine gluconate I.V. securement dressing", from anesthesiology cart) for exit site, then and add 4x4 gauze + additional medium Tegaderms x2 on top of the remaining length of catheter. <br>

Discharge w bacitracin topical ointment + Tylenol #3 x10 tablets. Dressing stays in place for 5 days. <b>First use of catheter should be <u>no later than 15 days</u> after surgery</b>.<br>

### Management of Intermittent Claudication (I70.211/212/213) 

Relevant information to elicit = symptom quality (location, characteristics, severity, relieving/exacerbating factors), functional impairment, any employment requirements, current exercise regimen (beyond what is done for utilitarian walking), and smoking status (transtheoretical model stage: pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, maintenance). Feel for pulses: femoral, popliteal, pedal. <br>

All should walk out with one of our claudication brochures and [guidance on how to engage in a community-based exercise program (19"23s video)](https://youtu.be/uWyBtbZ_dko). Follow-up at 3 months with an <b>activity log</b>, then q6 months vs. as needed if stable, non-limiting symptoms. Repeat or initial ABIs are not needed unless clinically indicated. Reserve cilostazol (non-formulary medication) for persons who have engaged in an consistent exercise regimen but remain funtionally limited. Counsel on average of +75 feet pain-free walking distance but increased incidence of headache, dizziness, palpitations, and diarrhea. Class 3 or 4 heart failure is a contraindication.<br>

Additional resources:<br>
1. Read the [AHA scientific statement here on exercise for claudication](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30586765/). <br>
2. Read this [chapter on claudication from Cameron’s Current Surgical Management](https://bcmedu-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/nbarshes_bcm_edu/EXhfQyt-WXtFvZ_SVxAq5YQBGQqtT0kPmt-8-W0BoHZYTw?e=nv1OfX) to know when surgical management might be appropriate or beneficial for patients with claudication and how to determine what treatments might be appropriate. <br>

### Surgical Management of Carotid Disease (I65.21/22) 

In the clinic, differentiate symptomatic vs. asymptomatic. If symptomatic: episode characterization and timing. 50+% stenosis on an imaging modality generally represents a legitamate indication.

If asymptomatic:<br>
- if <50%: repeat imaging not recommended, follow-up with primary care provider.
- 50-69%: repeat imaging in 1 year. Re-refer if >70%
- if >70%: clinic; discuss if good predicted 5-year survival and interested in intervention after citing 2% vs 1% annual risk. If yes, CTA & OR date; if no= yearly repeat US & clinic. <br>

If atypical symptoms (i.e. not stroke, TIA or transient monocular blindness but other symptoms including near-syncope or light-headedness): ask about premonitory symptoms, symptoms/signs during the event (duration; pallor or diaphoresis; incontinence, clonic movements; eyes open or closed) and residual symptoms after the event (fatigue, aches; oriented; headache). Consider MRI vs. CT for old stroke. 

Before the case: Verify that the patient has been taking aspirin (incl. day of surgery). LeMaitre 0.8 x 8cm bovine carotid patch in the room.<br>

Positioning & prep: Foley. Shoulder roll and head rotated to right. If outside of OR4, “beach chair” bed position.<br>

Equipment and supplies: Ioban drape; Ortho tip suction; Argyle shunts; rigid a-line tubing for stump pressure; 6-0 Prolene with both C1 (large) and BV (small) needles.<br>

Key steps:
1.	Early exposure: stay on SCM. stick tie facial vein.
2.	Identify vagus, hypoglossal.
3.	Dissect lateral side of CCA-->ICA, then medial side ICA-->CCA.
4.	Prepare to clamp and shunt (bulldog, large profunda, Rummel), then measure stump pressure (if asymptomatic patient)
5.	Clamp +/- shunt.
6.	Endarterectomy: like removing a perforated page from a book.
7.	Patch closure: 6-0 Prolene with BV needle on distal side, C1 proximal.
8.	Bone-dry for hemostasis. Closure. Steristrips & coverlet. 
Foley out at the end of the case.

Post-op: daily aspirin. At least two additional anti-hypertensive meds (other than home med doses, other than clonidine) to maintain SBP goal of 90-140mmHg. Discharge home with 15 tablets of tramadol OR 10 tables of Tylenol #3.

### Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms (ICD code I71.4)

Relevant information = size per radiology report, any symptoms, tobacco use. 
If <3.5cm, re-refer after q3 year NON-CONTRAST imaging (ultrasound via main radiology or NON-contrast C.T.). If 3.5-4.9cm, q1 year imaging. If >5.0cm, q6 mos. imaging. 

### endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) surveillance (ICD code I71.4)

Relevant information = operation & date, results of previous surveillance imaging. Surveillance @1 month, then q12 mos. if no endoleak.


### Venous Leg Ulcers (ICD code I83.012/.022 for ulcer, I83.811/.812 for inflammation)

Relevant information = history of compression therapy, wound therapy, measurements (see ECL Wound Care Clinic notes), any prior arterial testing. If non-invasive arterial testing abnormal (as described [here](https://nealbarshes.github.io/PAD/)), angiogram and possible intervention. If using compression therapy and not healing (i.e. not 50% or more area reduction within 6 weeks), get venous insufficiency study. 


### Varicose veins without ulceration (ICD code I83.012/.022 for ulcer, I83.811/.812 for inflammation)

Relevant information = symptoms, use of compression stockings, prior treatments, prior imaging. ECL wound care team if not already seen by them. If severely symptomatic despite consistent use of compression stockings for at least three months --> venous insufficiency study; saphenous vein ablation if valvular incompetence in the thigh segment of that vein. 

If s/p recent vein intervention: single follow-up at 1-2 weeks with post-intervention 2nd floor radiology ultrasound to r/o DVT.


### PAD and ischemic rest pains (ICD code I70.221/.222)

Relevant information = same as claudication. Feel for femoral pulses. If normal, schedule for angiogram; if abnormal, CTA. Also schedule for OR. If pains are not clearly ischemic in origin, confirm with toe pressures <30mmHg or ankle pressures <50mmHg. 

 
### Less frequent but important problems we may see together: 

1. Identify and treat [acute limb ischemia](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22670905/) and compartment syndrome, including –rarely-- of the [foot](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25752690/).  <br>

### Pathologies worth discussing while you're on our rotation:
1.	Mesenteric ischemia, four forms
2.	Massive PE
3.	Steal syndrome
4.	Carotid dissetion
5.	Carotid body tumor
6.	Superficial thrombophlebitis
7.	Popliteal aneurysm
