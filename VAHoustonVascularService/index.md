# Welcome to the Michael E. DeBakey V.A. Medical Center Vascular Surgery Service! 

Our rotation began as part of the Baylor College of Medicine peripheral vascular surgery training program initiated by Dr. Michael E. DeBakey in the 1980s{[1](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_History_of_Surgery_in_Houston.html?id=vuKJNgAACAAJ)}. It is currently the busiest VA vascular surgery service in the country. We serve a patient population with a more racial diversity than even the city of Houston as a whole{[2](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/houstoncitytexas)}. You will have an unparalleled opportunity to learn about the surgical management of vascular disease and gain operative skills.  

## Service Ethos & Structure

1. The tenets guiding our service structure are as follows:  
2. Providing outstanding patient care. 
3. Respecting all persons (and having comportment that demonstrates this) 
4. Personal responsibility and [disintermediation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disintermediation).  

As of February 2021 we have transitioned from the “mega-team” model to the “junior attending” model. This team structure is most similar to the vast majority of clinical practices outside of academic medical centers.   

In general, as much of the clinical decision making done by the staff surgeon and senior trainee taking ownership for the patient (accountability) while minimizing cross-coverage for non-urgent issues during business hours by persons not immediately involved on the patient’s care (“disintermediation").  It provides more individualized teaching opportunities for senior and junior trainees. Finally, this also avoids the potential conflicts of having two senior trainees on the same service as described in the ACGME "common program requirements” section IV.C.8.c:   
<blockquote style="border: 2px solid ##f6ff7a; font-style: normal; padding: 15px; font-size:12px; background-color: ##fdffde;">
"[a] chief resident and a fellow (whether the fellow is in an ACGME-accredited position or not) must not have primary responsibility for the same patient except that general surgeon and surgical critical care fellows may co-manage the non-operative care of the same patient.”</blockquote>

### Expectation of all trainees:

NEVER: 
<ul>
  <li>Use disrespectful language or actions with any others (including, but not limited to, patients, students, residents or nurses).</li>
  <li>Hide/block/deflecting consults in any way.</li>
  <li>Display dishonesty or any other blatant forms of unprofessionalism.</li>
  <li>Be absent or tardy without discussing with surgery education office <b>AND</b> staff vascular surgeon (<i>not</i> another trainee, regardless of PGY level)</li>
  </ul>

Commit to:
<ul>
  <li>Getting to the operating room as much as possible, even if just to assist or observe.</li>
  <li>Saying “I don’t know, but I'll find out” when you aren't 100% confident in being 100% factually correct about something.</li> 
  <li>Discuss operative plans before the day of the operation.</li>
  <li>Consuming, digesting and integrating all aspects of our patient’s history, exam findings, lab results, imaging, and hospital course.</li>
  <li>Utilizing down-time for more reading and dedicated practice of surgical skills, less social media.</li>
  <li>Contributing to leave the service -- and the call room/work room --- better than how you found it.</li>
</ul>

### Expectations for the "<i>Consult Intern</i>":
<b>Top priority:</b> inital evaluation of new inpatient consults. This includes:
1. Vascular surgery consults 24/7.
2. New diabetic foot infection consults (not previously seen by a surgical team at MEDVAMC for the infected site in question) on <b>Tuesdays</b>, <b>Fridays</b> and <b>Saturdays</b>. 
3. Diabetic foot infection consults for patients previously seen by our team for infection 24/7.

Notes:
<ul>
<li>Per hospital policy, ER consults must be seen within 30 mins and have written plans (note or admission orders within 90 minutes).</li>
<li>You should work as a teamlet with the on-call senior resident and on-call staff vascular surgeon. Discuss foot infection consults directly with staff surgeon, then discuss with on-call senior resident.</li>
<li>You should to the OR to talk if that is where the on-call senior or staff surgeon is.</li>  
<li>You should write OCL History and Physicals for new admissions and consults. </li>
<li>You should <b>NOT</b> be involved in inpatient care.</li>
</ul>
<b>Second priority:</b> daily scheduled outpatient encounters (telephone and face-to-face). 

### Expectations for <i>"Inpatient Intern"</i>: 
<ul>
<li>On Thursdays, in clinic for face-to-face outpatient encounters.</li>
<li>Other days: Working in a dyad with the second senior-most trainee. Make rounds together. Share note and order writing equitably. You should be in the OR when he or she is in the OR. You should both see consults together.</li> 
</ul>
  
### Expectations of the Night Intern: 
<ul>
<li>Ensure complete preoperative preparations for all inpatients done in timely fashion.</li>
<li>Ensure complete preoperative preparations for first outpatient / elective case of the morning Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays.</li>  
<li>Inital evaluation of consults (see Daytime Intern #1, above).</li>
</ul>

### Expectations and Objectives for PGY-2 Residents: 
<ul>
<li>Able to independently perform vein mapping for hemodialysis access.</li>
<li>In addition to dialysis access cases assigned, double-scrubbing as many cases as many other vascular cases.</li>
<li>In daytime, see dialysis access and venous disease consults if not in the OR.</li>
<li>Present Monday through Friday until at least 3pm. Utilize non-clinical time for robotic training and reading on vascular topics. </li>
</ul>
  
### Expectations for PGY-4-7 Senior Trainees: 
<b>Always / every day weekday:</b>

<ul>
<li>Twice-daily rounds, daily notes and orders.</li>
<li>Daily list run with relevant staff surgeon.</li>
<li>Inpatient nurse practicioner <span>&#177;</span>social worker <span>&#177;</span>case manager <span>&#177;</span>pharmacist. Please ask the inpatient intern (<b>ONLY</b>) if assigned to you on that given day), the nurse practicioner, or the relevant staff surgeon for help with inpatient work if you will be in OR or otherwise unable to do time-sensitive work. </li>
<li>Write the initial post-operative orders for any operations you do as primary resident -- even if you are working with the inpatient intern.
<li>Guiding and teaching any daytime intern assigned to you. He or she should be in the OR when you are in the OR. You should both see consults together. You should divide work equitably and according to experience.  Interns should be assigned a week at a time by seniority, with PGY-7, then PGY-6 or vascular PGY-4 or general PGY-4.  When two or more senior of equal level are on service, intern assignment will alternate by week.</li>
<li>Vascular residents and fellows: Identify educational, professional and technical goals using the updated ACGME Vascular Milestones document (expanded version). Understand how to optimize educational feedback.</li> 
<li>Read, especially Rutherford, to improve your medical knowledge and prepare for weekly conference. </li>
</ul>

<br>
<b>When on-call:</b>
<ul>
<li>Run the outpatient telephone (Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday) clinic or the in-person clinic (Thursdays). Please note that this does <b>NOT</b> preclude you from physically going to the OR to see critical portions of cases. If a patient of yours is scheduled for surgery when you are on-call, however, consider a 1:1 swap of daytime call with another senior trainee.</li>
<li>Evaluate all consults (other than foot infections), discuss with on-call staff surgeon, and <b>write a consult note</b> (not the OCL History and Physical).</li>
<li>Once finished with clinic and seeing any inpatient consults, go to the OR. to get involved with cases. On-call senior should probably plan to do cases anticipated to go late.</li>
<li>Receive late afternoon or evening check-out from off-call seniors and discuss to-do activities with on-call nighttime intern.</li>
<li>On weekends, rounds on all inpatients.</li>
</ul>
Please note that all patients admitted or otherwise evaluated are assigned to the on-call senior resident, including foot infections. In other words, there are no longer any “intern patients” as our service used to do with the diabetic foot service we used to run. Interns should be actively involved in the care of patients assigned to the senior trainee he or she is working with, but the intern does not assume sole responsibility.
<br>
<b>When not on-call:</b>
<ul>  
<li>In operating room as much as possible.</li>
<li>Present in the hospital until 3pm when not in the operating room.</li>
<li>Discuss operative plans, inpatient management with staff surgeons.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<li>What to do: (<i>pending content</i>)</li>
</ul>


#### Sharps injury, in operating room or anywhere else: 
<b>First</b>, scrub out of the case.
<ul>
  <li>If skin, wash with soap.</li>
  <li>If eye, rinse with eye irrigation bottle system  located by the handwashing sinks.</li>
</ul>
<b>Second</b>, get your blood drawn: 
<ul>
  <li>If M-F daytime, MEDVAMC Employee Health office at 4B room 231, phone 713-794-7003.</li> 
  <li>If nights/weekends, MEDVAMC emergency department.</li>
</ul>
<b>Third</b>, call <a href="https://www.bcm.edu/departments/medicine/sections-and-divisions/occupational-health-program">Baylor Occupational Health</a> at 713-798-8880 the next business day (hours: Monday through Friday 7:30 a.m. - noon and 1 - 4:30 p.m.) re: additional follow up. Provide copies of source testing results (<i>if available</i> -- see below) and of your testing results to Baylor Occupational Health for your file. MEDVAMC Employee Health does not provide a copy of the results to Baylor Occupational Health; this is your responsibility.
<br>
<br>
Know that within the VA system, [verbal consent from the patient IS required for HIV testing](https://www.hiv.va.gov/provider/topics/testing-faq-occupational-exposures.asp). Therefore, <b>do NOT</b> ask for a needlestick exposure panel during the case; someone from the surgery team must obtain verbal consent when the patient has decision-making capacity. 

#### Tips for working with our nurse practicioners: (<i>pending content</i>)

#### Quality Improvement
The [BCM MED Department of Surgery reporting of “near-misses", errors and safety issues.](https://orit.research.bcm.edu/Surgery/SurgerySelfReporting/Login.aspx) should be used for quality improvement related to these events.

<br>
#### Options for giving feedback on the rotation: 
<ol>
