# Welcome to the Michael E. DeBakey V.A. Medical Center Vascular Surgery Service! 

Our rotation began as part of the Baylor College of Medicine peripheral vascular surgery training program initiated by Dr. Michael E. DeBakey in the 1980s[1](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_History_of_Surgery_in_Houston.html?id=vuKJNgAACAAJ). It is currently the busiest VA vascular surgery service in the country. We serve a patient population with a more racial diversity than even the city of Houston as a whole[2](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/houstoncitytexas). You will have an unparalleled opportunity to learn about the surgical management of vascular disease and gain operative skills.  

## Service Ethos & Structure

1. The tenets guiding our service structure are as follows:  
2. Providing outstanding patient care. 
3. Respecting all persons (and having comportment that demonstrates this) 
4. Personal responsibility and [disintermediation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disintermediation).  

As of February 2021 we have transitioned from the “mega-team” model to the “junior attending” model. This team structure is most similar to the vast majority of clinical practices outside of academic medical centers.   

In general, as much of the clinical decision making done by the staff surgeon and senior trainee taking ownership for the patient (accountability) while minimizing cross-coverage for non-urgent issues during business hours by persons not immediately involved on the patient’s care (“disintermediation").  It provides more individualized teaching opportunities for senior and junior trainees. Finally, this also avoids the potential conflicts of having two senior trainees on the same service as described in the ACGME "common program requirements” section IV.C.8.c:

"[a] chief resident and a fellow (whether the fellow is in an ACGME-accredited position or not) must not have primary responsibility for the same patient except that general surgeon and surgical critical care fellows may co-manage the non-operative care of the same patient.”</blockquote>.
