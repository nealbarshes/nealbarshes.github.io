# Welcome to the Michael E. DeBakey V.A. Medical Center Vascular Surgery Service! 

Our rotation began as part of the Baylor College of Medicine peripheral vascular surgery training program initiated by Dr. Michael E. DeBakey in the 1980s{[1](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_History_of_Surgery_in_Houston.html?id=vuKJNgAACAAJ)}. It is currently the busiest VA vascular surgery service in the country. With 43.5% of our limb salvage population categorized as Black or Hispanic and patients travelling here from throughout southeast Texas, we serve very diverse patient population. You will have an unparalleled opportunity to learn about the surgical management of vascular disease and gain operative skills.  

This page describes the service structure and roles. There are additional pages for [limb salvage protocols](https://nealbarshes.github.io) and for [everything else](https://nealbarshes.github.io/EverythingElse/). 

## Service Ethos & Structure

The tenets guiding our service structure are:  
1. Providing outstanding patient care. 
2. Respecting all persons (and having comportment that demonstrates this). 
3. Personal responsibility and [disintermediation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disintermediation).
4. Feedback as a necessity for growth and learning.

<blockquote style="border: 2px solid ##f6ff7a; font-style: normal; padding: 15px; font-size:12px; background-color: ##fdffde;">
"The acquisition of skills requires a regular environment, and adequate opportunity to practice, and <b>rapid and unequivocal feedback about the correctness of thoughts and actions</b>. When these conditions are fullfilled, skill eventually develops, and the intuitive judgments and choices that quickly come to mind will mostly be accurate.” Daniel Kahneman, <i>Thinking Fast and Slow</i></blockquote>
<br>
<br>
As of February 2021 we have transitioned from the “mega-team” model to the “junior attending” model. This team structure is most similar to the vast majority of clinical practices outside of academic medical centers. This means that as much of the clinical decision making done by the staff surgeon and senior trainee taking ownership for the patient (accountability) while minimizing cross-coverage for non-urgent issues during business hours by persons not immediately involved on the patient’s care (“disintermediation").  This structure also provides more individualized teaching opportunities for senior and junior trainees. Finally, this also avoids the potential conflicts of having two senior trainees on the same service as described in the ACGME "common program requirements” section IV.C.8.c.   
<br>
<hr>

### Expectation of all trainees:

NEVER: 
<ul>
  <li>Use disrespectful language or actions with any others (including, but not limited to, patients, students, residents or nurses).</li>
  <li>Hide/block/deflecting consults in any way.</li>
  <li>Display dishonesty or any other blatant forms of unprofessionalism.</li>
  <li>Be absent or tardy without discussing with surgery education office <b>AND</b> staff vascular surgeon (<i>not</i> another trainee, regardless of PGY level)</li>
  </ul>

Commit to:
<ul>
  <li>Getting to the operating room as much as possible, even if just to assist or observe.</li>
  <li>Saying “I don’t know, but I'll find out” when you aren't 100% confident in being 100% factually correct about something.</li> 
  <li>Discuss operative plans with involved staff surgeon <b>before</b> the day of the operation.</li>
  <li>Consuming, digesting and integrating all aspects of our patient’s history, exam findings, lab results, imaging, and hospital course.</li>
  <li>Utilizing down-time for more reading and dedicated practice of surgical skills, less social media.</li>
  <li>Contributing to leave the service -- and the call room/work room --- better than how you found it.</li>
</ul>


### Expectations for Daytime/Inpatient Interns: 
<ul>  
<li>Working in a dyad with your paired senior trainee. Make rounds together. Share note and order writing equitably. You should be in the OR when he or she is in the OR, and you should be doing face-to-face or telephone encounters when he or she is assigned to cover a clinic day. You should both see consults together.</li>
<li>On Thursdays, in clinic for face-to-face outpatient encounters.</li>
<li>For initial evaluation of new inpatient or emergency room consults:</li>
  <ul>
<li>Vascular surgery consults 24/7.</li>
<li>New diabetic foot infection consults (not previously seen by a surgical team at MEDVAMC for the infected site in question) on Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays.</li>
<li>Diabetic foot infection consults for patients previously seen by our team for infection 24/7.</li>
</ul>
  </ul>
  
Notes:
<ul>
<li>Per hospital policy, ER consults must be seen within 30 mins and have written plans (note or admission orders within 120 minutes).</li>
<li>You should work as a team with the on-call senior resident and on-call staff vascular surgeon. Discuss foot infection consults directly with staff surgeon, then discuss with on-call senior resident.</li>
<li>You should go to the OR to talk if that is where the on-call senior or staff surgeon is.</li>
<li>You should write OCL History and Physicals for new admissions and consults.</li>
</ul>
  
### Expectations of the Night Float Intern: 
<ul>
  <li>Initial evaluation of new consults after 6pm.</li>
    <li>Complete post-operative checks (with notes) on all patients who have come out of the operating room after 3pm.</li>
      <li>Direct communication of overnight clinical events with the senior-most vascular trainee responsible for the patient.</li>
  <li>Avoid ordering daily labs on inpatients.</li>
</ul>

### Expectations and Objectives for PGY-2 Residents: 
<ul>
<li>Able to independently perform vein mapping for hemodialysis access.</li>
<li>In addition to dialysis access cases assigned, double-scrubbing as many cases as many other vascular cases.</li>
<li>In daytime, see dialysis access and venous disease consults if not in the OR.</li>
<li>Present Monday through Friday until at least 3pm. Utilize non-clinical time for robotic training and reading on vascular topics. </li>
</ul>
  
### Expectations for PGY-4-7 Senior Trainees: 
<b>Always / every day weekday:</b>

<ul>
<li>Twice-daily rounds, daily notes and orders.</li>
  <li>Round with your junior resident twice a day and divide daily notes and orders equitably.</li>
<li>Teach and delegate level-appropriate responsibilities.</li>
<li>When appropriate, guide your junior resident through parts of procedures.</li>
<li>Daily list run with relevant staff surgeon, Inpatient nurse practicioner (<span>&#177;</span>social worker <span>&#177;</span>case manager <span>&#177;</span>pharmacist).</li>
<li>If you will be in OR or otherwise unable to do time-sensitive work, request the help of the inpatient intern assigned to you on that given day, the inpatient nurse practicioner, or the relevant staff surgeon. </li>
<li>Write the initial post-operative orders for any operations you do as primary resident -- even if you are working with the inpatient intern.</li>
  <li>Be judicious in the use of lab testing. Follow recommendations in our protocols. If not otherwise specified, chemistries and blood counts every Monday and Thursday for patients not on hemodialysis. If on hemodialysis: chemistries daily, blood counts Monday and Friday.</li>
<li>Guiding and teaching any daytime intern assigned to you. He or she should be in the OR when you are in the OR. You should both see consults together. You should divide work equitably and according to experience.  Interns should be assigned a week at a time by seniority, with PGY-7, then PGY-6 or vascular PGY-4 or general PGY-4.  When two or more senior of equal level are on service, intern assignment will alternate by week.</li>
<li>Vascular residents and fellows: Identify educational, professional and technical goals using the updated ACGME Vascular Milestones document (expanded version). Understand how to optimize educational feedback.</li> 
<li>Read, especially Rutherford, to improve your medical knowledge and prepare for weekly conference. </li>
<li>When assigned, help organize and conduct the outpatient telephone clinic (Monday, Tuesday and/or Wednesday) or the in-person clinic (Monday and Thursdays). Please note that this does NOT preclude you from physically going to the OR to see or participate in critical portions of cases. If a patient of yours is scheduled for surgery when you are on-call, however, consider a 1:1 swap of daytime call with another senior trainee.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<b>When on-call:</b>
<ul>
<li>Go to the OR. to get involved with cases.</li>
<li>Evaluate all consults (other than foot infections), discuss with on-call staff surgeon, and <b>write a consult note</b> (not the OCL History and Physical).</li>
<li>Receive late afternoon or evening check-out from off-call seniors and discuss to-do activities with on-call nighttime intern.</li>
<li>On weekends, rounds on all inpatients.</li>
<li>Notify on-call faculty if staying from your daytime shift until 10:30pm or later (continuously -- does NOT include coming back to the hospital) for help in adjusting your schedule the following day.</li> 
</ul>

<b>When assigned to clinic:</b>
<ul>
<li>Work with your assigned PGY-1/2/4, the outpatient clinic-assigned nurse practicioner, and the clinic-assigned staff surgeon to complete telephone and any face-to-face consults.</li>
<li>Once finished with clinic and seeing any inpatient consults, go to the OR. to get involved with cases. On-call senior should probably plan to do cases anticipated to go late.</li>
<li>Receive late afternoon or evening check-out from off-call seniors and discuss to-do activities with on-call nighttime intern.</li>
<li>On weekends, rounds on all inpatients.</li>
<li>Notify on-call faculty if staying from your daytime shift until 10:30pm or later (continuously -- does NOT include coming back to the hospital) for help in adjusting your schedule the following day.</li> 
</ul>

<br>
Please note that all patients admitted or otherwise evaluated are assigned to the on-call senior resident, including foot infections. In other words, there are no longer any “intern patients” as our service used to do with the diabetic foot service we used to run. Interns should be actively involved in the care of patients assigned to the senior trainee he or she is working with, but the intern does not assume sole responsibility.

<br>
<b>When not on-call:</b>
<ul>  
<li>In operating room as much as possible.</li>
<li>Present in the hospital until 3pm when not in the operating room.</li>
<li>Face-to-face or telephone hand-off to on-call senior resident; this is NOT to be done via text, email or any other modality.</li>
<li>Discuss the next day's operative plans, inpatient management with staff surgeons.</li>
</ul>
<br>

### Best Practices:
1. No abbreviations whatsoever in O.R. postings or consent forms.
2. Always use a pharmacy reference (ex. Epocrates or Lexicomp, which is through CPRS under "Tools") to ensure new or high-risk medication orders are without error.


### Regarding consents:
<p style="color:green">DO / ALWAYS:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Include any relevant possibles:</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Surgical bypass: possible angiogram with peripheral intervention.</li>
    <li>AV graft: possible AV fistula.</li>
    <li>AV fistula: possible AV graft ONLY if E.S.R.D., not if CKD5.</li>
  </ol>
  <li>Include names of three staff surgeons.</li>
  <li>Select "anesthesia practicioner will be present ..."</li>
  <li>SPELL OUT any/all anatomic locations without abbreviating.</li>
  <li>Discuss "YES. The patient (or surrogate) consents for the use of blood products" for <i>all</i> cases. </li>
  <li>Select "Vendor will be present ..." for peripheral endovascular, EVAR and TCAR cases.</li>
  <li>Select "YES" for "Tissues will be disposed of"</li>
  <li>Select "Patient information will be disclosed to device manufacturer ..." for EVAR and TCAR cases.</li>
</ol>

Common 


<p style="color:red">Do NOT:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Type in "all indicated procedures" as part of the procedure.</li>
  </ol>
</p>

### Habits that lead to satisfied patients that trust you:
1. Introduce yourself and state your role.
2. Make no promises you can't keep. (In general, underpromising and overproducing is much preferred to the reverse). 
3. Be comfortable saying "I don't know, but I'll find out." Then find out and follow through.
4. Spend 50% of your interaction with a patient <b>listening</b>.
5. Explain everything you are going to do.
6. Make sure someone will call family / friend after the case.
7. Put family / friend on the COVID visitation list for the patient.

### Uncommon but Important Scenarios: 
<br>
#### Our team’s process for transitioning clinical responsibilities when fatigue is an issue:
Thank you to Dr. Zachary Chizmar for helping develop this material!

Transitioning clinical responsibilities is <i>mandatory</i> when:
1. ill or fatigued
2. additional clinical work would exceed 320 hours during any consecutive four week period
3. on-call activities for senior trainees reaches a 24 hour period; see VI.F.3. of the [ACGME Common program requirements](https://www.acgme.org/Portals/0/PFAssets/ProgramRequirements/CPRs_Section%20VI_with-Background-and-Intent_2017-01.pdf)
 
Use the I-PASS acronym for hand-offs of clinical responsibilities:

Letter | Component
------------ | -------------
I= | Illness severity: stable, "watcher", unstable
P= | Patient summary
A= | Action list 
S= | Situational awareness
S= | Synthesis by receiver


#### Sharps injury, in operating room or anywhere else: 
<b>First</b>, scrub out of the case.
<ul>
  <li>If skin, wash with soap.</li>
  <li>If eye, rinse with eye irrigation bottle system  located by the handwashing sinks.</li>
</ul>
<b>Second</b>, get your blood drawn: 
<ul>
  <li>If M-F daytime, MEDVAMC Employee Health office at 4B room 231, phone 713-794-7003.</li> 
  <li>If nights/weekends, MEDVAMC emergency department.</li>
</ul>
<b>Third</b>, call <a href="https://www.bcm.edu/departments/medicine/sections-and-divisions/occupational-health-program">Baylor Occupational Health</a> at 713-798-8880 the next business day (hours: Monday through Friday 7:30 a.m. - noon and 1 - 4:30 p.m.) re: additional follow up. Provide copies of source testing results (<i>if available</i> -- see below) and of your testing results to Baylor Occupational Health for your file. MEDVAMC Employee Health does not provide a copy of the results to Baylor Occupational Health; this is your responsibility.
<br>
<br>
Know that within the VA system, [verbal consent from the patient IS required for HIV testing](https://www.hiv.va.gov/provider/topics/testing-faq-occupational-exposures.asp). Therefore, <b>do NOT</b> ask for a needlestick exposure panel during the case; someone from the surgery team must obtain verbal consent when the patient has decision-making capacity. 

#### Tips for working with our nurse practicioners: (<i>pending content</i>)
<br>
#### Quality Improvement
The [BCM MED Department of Surgery reporting of “near-misses", errors and safety issues.](https://orit.research.bcm.edu/Surgery/SurgerySelfReporting/Login.aspx) should be used for quality improvement related to these events.

<br>
#### Options for giving feedback on the rotation: 
<ol>
<li>Talk with one of the staff surgeons.</li>
<li>Talk with one of the senior trainees.</li>
<li>Talk with Dr. Barshes (vascular fellowship program director) or Dr. Kougias (general surgery residency rotation director).</li>
<li>Provide written feedback on your end-of-rotation summary.</li>
<li>Provide feedback on the annual (spring) annual residency program survey.</li>
</ol>
