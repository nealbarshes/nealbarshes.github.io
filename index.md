## Neal R. Barshes, M.D., M.P.H.

As an academic vascular surgeon, I work to develop cost-effective, resilient and equitable strategies to prevent leg amputations.

This page serves as a repository for resources I am sharing to help others with research- and policy-/outreach-related efforts to reduce leg amputations.

### <i>Guard your Feet</i> patient educational brochures

<i>Guard your Feet</i> is a ~500 word brochure written to help persons at risk for foot ulcers and amputation with:
1. Understanding how diabetes can lead to foot ulcers and infections.
2. Quantifying amputation risk
3. Actions that reduce amputation risk
4. Recognizing foot infection
5. Developing an contingency plan for treatment

This brochure is written at the 8th grade level with minimal technical language. Fantastic people here in Houston have helped translate it into 9 other languages. Please feel free to download and distribute these brochures. Use them to start a conversation with your patients.
