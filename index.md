As an academic vascular surgeon, I work to develop cost-effective, resilient and equitable strategies to prevent leg amputations.

This contains a portfolio of resources I am sharing to help others interested in reducing the rate of leg amputations. 

Health professionals interested in getting overview of the spectrum of care to avoid leg amputations can read our 2013 ["System of Care" review paper](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/articles/Barshes%2C%20system%20of%20care%202013.pdf) or our 2011 ["framework" review paper](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/articles/Barshes%2C%20framework%20for%20foot%20keeping.pdf). This 2019 ["Advances in PAD" paper](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/articles/Barshes%20%26%20Grant%2C%20PAD%20advances%202019.pdf) describes state-of-the-art developments in management.

This two-page [health policy brief](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/articles/UTMB%20CEHB%20brief%201602%2C%20amputation%20disparities.pdf), written with the University of Texas Medical Branch's Center to Eliminate Health Disparities, summarizes the problems caused by leg amputations and suggests some steps forward. 


### Patient Education Brochures

<i>Guard your Feet</i> is a ~500 word brochure written to help persons at risk for foot ulcers and amputation with understanding how diabetes can lead to foot ulcers and infections and quantifying amputation risk. It helps people reduce their amputation risk, recognize a foot infection, and develop a contingency plan if infection does develop.

This brochure is written at the 8th grade level with minimal technical language and has been reviewed by patients. Fantastic colleagues here in Houston have helped translate it from English into nine other languages. Please feel free to download and distribute these brochures. Use them to start a conversation with your patients.

#### Tenets of Treatment:
1. [Deep infections get drained/incised.](https://nealbarshes.github.io/FootInfection/) 
2. [Ensure or establish adequate arterial inflow.](https://nealbarshes.github.io/PAD/)
3. [Reconstruct, reestablishing intact epithelium over the entire extremity.](https://nealbarshes.github.io/FootHealing/)
4. Maintain mobility through the avoidance of amputation.

### A Selection of Our Manuscripts Relevant to Clinical Care 

1. [Foot ulcer prevention](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/articles/Barshes%2C%20DFU%20prevention%20cost-savings.pdf) clearly represents to best opportunity for cost savings: reduced amputation rates + lower cost than current care. 
2. All patients with large or infected foot ulcers merit [objective testing (toe pressures, skin perfusion pressures, or angiogram) to identify peripheral artery disease](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/articles/Barshes%2C%20PAD%20identification%20strategies.pdf). [This diagram](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/assets/PADalgorithm1.jpg) demonstrates the optimal diagnostic strategies for peripheral artery disease identification.
3. Leg bypass operations have [lower perioperative mortality than leg amputation](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/articles/BarshesAmpVsBypassRisk.pdf) in patients with advanced comorbidities.
3. Providing revascularization and limb salvage efforts appears to be [cost-effective for all patients](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/articles/Barshes%2C%20MOVIE%20analysis.pdf) and may even provide [cost-savings in elderly, functionally-marginal patients](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/articles/Barshes%2C%20marginal%20patient%20bypass.pdf).
4. Foot infections in bone (osteomyelitis) with [E. coli or Pseudomonas](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/articles/Barshes%2C%20DFO%20treatment%20failure.pdf) are associated with worse outcomes; infections with methicillin-sensitive [Staphylococcus aureus](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/articles/Ashong%2C%20MRSA%20osteomyelitis%202016.pdf). 

### For Texans Interested in Addressing the Disparities in Leg Amputation Rates

1. Significant [racial and ethnic disparities persist](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/articles/Barshes%2C%20TX%20disparities%20NIHMS.pdf) in Texas, as people categorized as Black and people categorized as Hispanic undergo higher risk-adjusted rates of leg amputations than people categorized as White.
2. Geography and [lack of nearby specialist care at high-volume centers](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/assets/volume-ratio%20relationship%20v2.jpg) may [contribute to leg amputation rates in many areas of Texas](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/articles/BarshesRemoteAmputationCare.pdf) in [these areas of Texas](https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/assets/heat%20map%2C%20remote%20Texas%20amputees.jpeg).
